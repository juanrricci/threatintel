# Threat intelligence scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts for normalizing and decoding security threat data. These scripts can be useful for processing and analyzing threat intelligence information from various sources and formats, and converting it into a standardized and readable format.

The scripts include tools for normalizing IP addresses, domain names, email addresses, and file hashes, as well as for decoding encoded strings in Base64, ASCII, hexadecimal, and other formats.

This repository also includes some examples of how to use the scripts and a configuration file to customize their behavior. These resources can help users understand how to use the scripts in their own threat intelligence operations.
